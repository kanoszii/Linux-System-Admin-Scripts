# Bash Script for Changing Directory Permissions

This is a simple Bash script that allows you to change the permissions and group ownership of a directory on your Linux system. It prompts you for the directory path, group name, and numeric permissions format.

## Prerequisites

- Make sure you have the necessary permissions to change directory permissions.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the script to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.

3. Run the script by entering the following command:

   ```bash
   ./change_permissions.sh  

Follow the on-screen prompts to provide the required details:  
- Enter the path to the directory you wish to modify.
- Specify the group name for which you want to change permissions.
- Input the desired permissions in numeric format (e.g., 755).  
The script will apply the permissions and group ownership you specified to the directory.
Once the permissions have been successfully changed, you will receive a confirmation message.

## Note  
Feel free to use and modify this script to suit your needs for managing users and groups on a Linux system.
